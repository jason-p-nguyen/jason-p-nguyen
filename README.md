I’m curious about cybersecurity and love getting hands-on with real challenges.
Working on projects like reverse-engineering USB drop attacks and digging into Dropbox data leaks in Azure lets me experiment, analyze, and tell the story behind the logs.
Right now, I’m diving deeper into cloud security on Azure—learning how to spot threats using logs, endpoint tools, and security analytics.
